# avgTimeCalc

This is an algorithm that calculates the average time of 4 process scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, SRTF, RR).

Edit the jobs.txt to mod the process that you wanna test the algorithms on.

Run avgTime.py opening the terminal and typing these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/DevFefe/avgTimeCalc
cd avgTimeCalc
python3 avgTime.py
```
or for the tab version open the terminal and instead of 'python3 avgTime.py' type:
```
python3 avgTimeWithTabs.py
```
<br>
If you don't have tkinter install it by typing this in your terminal:<br><br>
<b>MacOS</b>
```
brew install python-tk
```
<b>Arch Linux</b>
```
sudo pacman -S tk
```
